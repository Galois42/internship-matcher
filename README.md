# **🔄 Internship-Match: Stable Matching Algorithm Implementation**

A Java-based ☕ implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm optimized for matching students with internship positions. This project provides a robust solution for creating stable, preference-respecting matches between employers and candidates.

## **🤝 Key Features**
- Efficient implementation of the Gale-Shapley stable marriage algorithm
- Generic key-value pair system for flexible preference representation
- Heap-based priority queue for optimized preference management  
- Dynamic matching adjustment capabilities
- Guarantees stable matching outcomes that respect all participants' preferences

## **🎯 Use Case**
Designed specifically for academic-industry partnership scenarios, this system can handle complex multi-participant matching scenarios where both employers and students have ranked preferences. The implementation ensures that no employer-student pair would mutually prefer each other over their assigned matches.

## **💻 Technical Highlights**
- Written in Java with focus on performance and maintainability
- Custom priority queue interface for efficient preference handling
- Thoroughly documented codebase with clear examples
- Scalable design suitable for various matching scenarios
